  <description>
    The JSON/Java Binding API is designed to bind JSON documents to Java objects. More specifically,
    the JSON/Java Binding API provides a way for JSON objects whose structure is expressed in the
    JSON Schema Definition Language to be parsed and marshaled, to and from Java objects of
    strongly-typed classes. The JSON/Java Binding API can also be used to validate JSON documents as
    they are parsed from text or marshaled from Java objects against a JSD. Thus, the JSON/Java
    Binding API is a reference implementation of the validation and binding functionalities of the
    JSON Schema Definition Language.
